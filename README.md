# HR-Analytics-Dashboard-Project

This project involved building a comprehensive HR analytics dashboard in Power BI to provide visibility into the organization's workforce data. By integrating and modeling employee data such as hire dates, end dates, departments, ratings, and gender, we developed interactive visuals for real-time tracking.

The dashboard revealed valuable patterns in attrition, hiring, and employee performance â€” enabling HR leaders to pinpoint problem areas and act proactively. The tool supports better workforce planning, diversity tracking, and talent management through data-backed decisions.
